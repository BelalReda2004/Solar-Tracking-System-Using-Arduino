# Solar-Tracking-System-Using-Arduino
A dual axis solar tracking system is a sophisticated mechanism designed to optimize the orientation of solar panels throughout the day to maximize energy capture. Unlike fixed or single-axis systems, dual-axis trackers can adjust both the azimuth (horizontal angle) and the elevation (vertical angle) of the solar panels. This system is particularly effective in maximizing solar energy absorption by following the sun's path across the sky.

Components :

Solar Panels: Photovoltaic panels to convert solar energy into electrical energy.
Microcontroller: To control the motors and ensure accurate tracking (e.g., Arduino).
Sensors: Light sensors (e.g., LDRs) to detect the sun's position.
Motors: Servo motors or stepper motors for precise movement.
Mounting Structure: A robust structure to hold the panels and motors.
Power Supply: Batteries, Arduino wire or other power sources to run the system.
Software: Programming logic to control the tracking algorithm.
Construction Steps:

Design the Mounting Structure: Build a frame that can securely hold the solar panels and allow movement in both axes.
Install Motors: Attach the motors to the frame for controlling the tilt and rotation.
Sensor Placement: Place light sensors strategically around the panels to detect the sunâ€™s position.
Microcontroller Setup: Program the microcontroller to process sensor data and control the motors accordingly.
Integration and Testing: Assemble all components, integrate the system, and test it under various conditions to ensure proper functionality
Conclusion :

Dual axis solar tracking systems represent a significant advancement in solar energy technology. Their ability to maximize solar energy capture makes them an attractive option for various applications, from residential to large-scale solar farms. Despite the higher initial costs, the long-term benefits in terms of efficiency, energy yield, and environmental impact make them a worthwhile investment. Embracing dual axis tracking technology can play a crucial role in advancing sustainable energy solutions and optimizing the use of solar power.
